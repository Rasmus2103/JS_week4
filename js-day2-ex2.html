        <h1>Reflections on Exercise-2</h1>
        <p>
            In this Exercise is the about the concept event bubling. The concept is about when a event acours in a element inside of another element
            and both elements have registered a handler for that event. 
            </p>
            
            <p>The element we have here is the red boxes, that are all 
            <strong>div-tags</strong> and have unique id's and outside of those tags we have another div-tag with a unique id called <strong>outer</strong>. 
            In the script we create an <strong>addEventListener</strong> with <strong>outer</strong>, and inside of that id, we create an event 
            that say print a text of the id of every red-box with the help of a paragraph tag, and in the addEventListener we have told it to 
            target the id of everything that is inside of the <strong>outer div-tag</strong>, and that is the red-boxes, and everytime we click
            on one of the red boxes it print out the id of every div-tag.</p>
            
            <p>In this case we have created a event bubling, because both of <strong>outer div-tag</strong> and the div-tags for the red-boxes have 
            an event connected to it, and everytime we click on anything we get one of the id printed out.
