            <p> 
                What have I done in this exercise is to add a button with onclick function in HTML-file, and then given the function I have created in my 
                script to change colors everytime we click on the button. I also did a background-color directly into the HTML document, but instead used
                the for-loop to select all of the div-tag element to change it to the color blue. We could just have added the background-color to a 
                seperate style tag or CSS file. The onclick on HTML button tag combined with function made it also very easy. Of course we could also have
                added an addEventListener in my script to make it change color.
